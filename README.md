### What's modified?

- merge four script files into one
- remove email feature, instead feature of netease cloud music (thank for [conky-spotify](https://github.com/Madh93/conky-spotify))

### How to use

Please make sure that you have installed conky with lua. If you use Arch Linux, you can find conky-lua in aur.

Then, just run `conky -c /path/to/script/conkyrc`, or you can use Conky Manager to launch it.

### What's more?

You can modify this script casually. And welcome to consult me when desired.
